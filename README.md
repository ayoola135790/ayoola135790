- 🌱 I’m currently learning: about how to better utlize AI to help create solutions to problems. As per my major, I am combining the use of linguistics and computer science, to learn about Natural Language Processing, a subset of Artificial Intelligence. I believe this would be able to help me in future practices for a career in technology, specifically with product management.
